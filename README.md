# Introduction
A simple particle system that is used to create blood-like particles on screen.

# Lessons Learned
- Using `sf::Mouse` to create objects at its screen and window position.
- Using `sf::Clock` to calculate FPS and track the lifetime of particles.
- Using `sin` and `cos` to smoothly animate shapes.
- Using object pooling to avoid creating/deleting objects at runtime.
