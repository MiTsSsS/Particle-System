# Introduction
A simple particle system that is used to create blood-like particles.

# Lessons Learned
- Using `sf::Mouse` to create objects at its screen and window position.
- Using `sf::Clock` to calculate FPS and track the lifetime of particles.
- Using `sin` and `cos` to smoothly animate shapes.
- Using object pooling to avoid creating/deleting objects at runtime.

# Future Work
- Adding UI elements to control the particles' properties at runtime, such as lifetime, color and more.
- Adding a 2D camera with a view.
